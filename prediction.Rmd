```

## Introduction

This project is about predicting stock price moving direction based on historical stock data. Historic data will be gathered from Yahoo Finance.

## Step 1: Transform data and create predictors

Pricing data for SPY will be used as an example for this project, with date range from 2007 to 2024.

```{r prediction}
plot(stock$rownames, stock$Close)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
